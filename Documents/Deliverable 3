Term Project, Deliverable Number 3
The User Interface of the Cinema E-Booking System __________________________________________________________________________________
Based on the analysis of the Cinema E-Booking System, implement the user interface of the system and submit the source code files (java, python. or the web interface) to the assignment folder on eLC, by your demo time.
Evaluation of this assignment will be by demonstrating the user interface to the instructor or the TAs. The actual due date is the time you schedule for your demo. The demo schedule is on eLC at this page.
Figma prototypes are not acceptable. You must program the frontend. You can start with a Figma prototype to discuss the UI design with your team and/or to check with the instructor or one of the TAs that you are designing the required UI.
Except for movie trailers, you don't have to implement functionalities, navigation from one screen to another, nor event handling.
  
The number of pages/windows depends on your UI design.
You must implement all the required windows based on your analysis of the project.
I expect that you will cover all use cases. Use your analysis models, imagination, innovation, and apply design principles.
